## Learning Objectives
### 1. Compare the structures, usages, strengths, and weaknesses of different data structures
Students will compare different data structures such as stack, queue, hashtables, trees, graphs,  and heaps, and their performances in different scenarios. There will be multiple Homework focusing on this objective.

### 2. Choose the appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve a given problem
Students will demonstrate their problem-solving skills by formulating a problem using fundamental data structures and algorithms. They may need to modify the known data structures and the algorithms or design new ones to solve a given problem programmatically. Programming assignments will be prepared to achieve this objective. 

### 3. Develop correct solutions to a problem and reason about the correctness
Students will infer the solution from the problem statement, use the correct combination of data structures and algorithms, and most importantly verify the correctness of their solutions with logical explanations. Midterms and finals will be designed to assess this objective. 

### 4. Evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms 
Students will extract the complexity of the algorithms and deduce them into best-case, average-case, and worst-case running times. Thus they will be able to infer the complexity of their own algorithms. Midterms and finals will be designed to assess this objective. 

### 5. Identify the loopholes in the implementation of an algorithm and optimize those to develop an efficient one
Students will make their programming assignments accepted by the auto graders. Programming auto graders may not accept a solution until it achieves a certain optimization level. Therefore, students will identify the complex part of their implementations and optimize their source codes to ensure better performance.

## Textbook
- Data Structure Essentials with C++ from zybooks
- Algorithm Design and Applications from  zybooks
We will be using a merge of these two textbooks from zybooks for reading assignments.
