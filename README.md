## Course description
The study of data structures and their applications. Correctness proofs and techniques for the design of correct programs. Graph traversal techniques and their applications. Searching. Hashing and balanced trees. Analysis of sorting algorithms.

## Learning Objectives:(LO.md) 
### 1. Compare the structures, usages, strengths, and weaknesses of different data structures
Students will compare different data structures such as stack, queue, hashtables, trees, graphs,  and heaps, and their performances in different scenarios. There will be multiple Homework focusing on this objective.

### 2. Choose the appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve a given problem
Students will demonstrate their problem-solving skills by formulating a problem using fundamental data structures and algorithms. They may need to modify the known data structures and the algorithms or design new ones to solve a given problem programmatically. Programming assignments will be prepared to achieve this objective. 

### 3. Develop correct solutions to a problem and reason about the correctness
Students will infer the solution from the problem statement, use the correct combination of data structures and algorithms, and most importantly verify the correctness of their solutions with logical explanations. Homeworks, midterm and final will be designed to assess this objective. 

### 4. Evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms 
Students will extract the complexity of the algorithms and deduce them into best-case, average-case, and worst-case running times. Thus they will be able to infer the complexity of their own algorithms. Homeworks, midterm and final will be designed to assess this objective. 

### 5. Identify the loopholes in the implementation of an algorithm and optimize those to develop an efficient one
Students will make their programming assignments accepted by the auto graders. Programming auto graders may not accept a solution until it achieves a certain optimization level. Therefore, students will identify the complex part of their implementations and optimize their source codes to ensure better performance.

## Textbook
- Data Structure Essentials with C++ from zybooks
- Algorithm Design and Applications from  zybooks
We will be using a merge of these two textbooks from zybooks for reading assignments. 

## Class Policy
- After each reading assignment, submit the online quizzes included in zyBooks within the due date. The due dates are added in the zybooks.
 
- For homework and programming assignments, please submit your solution in Gradescope.  No late submissions are accepted (Due at 11:00 PM). With very few exceptions [e.g. documented medical emergency], no personal extensions/exceptions will be given.
 
- You may discuss homework with your classmates, but please write down your own solution and acknowledge your collaborators. You must understand and be able to explain every single line that you hand in. Not being able to explain handed in work counts as cheating. 
 
- For homework problems and programming assignments you may not consult anyone other than fellow students, course instructors, or TA's regarding anything pertaining to particular homework problems. You are allowed to ask about general topics (greedy algorithms, solving recurrences) but nothing related to a particular problem (how do I solve *this* recurrence, how do I analyze *this* algorithm, etc). Of course, there are grey zones. Err on the side of caution.
 
- The policy above also applies to searching the internet and asking questions on forums. 
 
- Do not post solutions to homework problems online. You may post your programs for programming assignments online, but do not post any explanations/analyses.

## Grade Composition
15% zyBooks Reading Assignments
20% Homeworks (HW) (2 Homeworks counting 10% each)
20% Programming Assignments* (PA) (2 Assignments counting 10% each)
15% Midterm Exam
30% Final Exam

* Programming assignments will be comprised of multiple problems and students will be graded with the problem he receives the highest score.

# Academic Integrity
- Cheating WILL be taken seriously. It is not fair toward honest students to take cheating lightly, nor is it fair to the cheater to let him/her go on thinking that cheating is a reasonable alternative in life.
- The following is not considered cheating:
   - discussing broad ideas about programming assignments in groups, without being at a computer (with code-writing and debugging done individually, later).
- The following is considered cheating:
   - discussing programming assignments with someone who has already completed the problem, or looking at their completed solution.
   - looking at anyone else’s solution
   - Previous versions of the class.
   - leaving your code (for example in an online repository) visible to others, leading others to look at your solution.
   - receiving, providing, or soliciting assistance from unauthorized sources during a test.
- Programming assignments are not intended to be grade-makers, but to prepare you for the tests, which are the grade-makers. Cheating on the programming assignment is not only unethical, but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of these assignments.
- Penalties: First time: a zero for the assignment; Second time: an “F” in the course.
